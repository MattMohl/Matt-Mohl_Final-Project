As someone who plays Magic: The Gathering, I have some problems with the web support the game has currently. Nowhere will you find a MTG site that is actually built for the one thing it's about; the community. I want The Mana Pool to bring MTG players, new and seasoned alike, together in a themed environment built for a social experience. Users will be rewarded with exp to their profiles, which will allow them to unlock different items within the application, and possibly tangible prizes if enough traffic is seen. The Mana Pool will inspire new players to become more creative, while, at the same time, push others to give more useful and constructive feedback.
