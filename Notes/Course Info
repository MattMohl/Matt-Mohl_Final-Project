Each week I will need to turn in a:

Status Report: This is the letter to the stakeholders to let them know how the project is coming along. Accomplishments, challenges, and goals are included. For the first week I need to describe my project briefly.

and a

Week in Review: This is more or less my opinion on how I thought the week went. It seems to change each week so be CAREFUL.




Project Proposal

When a project begins, it is helpful to prepare a document that presents creative concepts. At a high level this form of documentation should include basic UI components and core functionality expected. The goal is for you to convey ideas quickly and to generate buy-in from key stakeholders. A well presented idea can generate excitement and help you obtain approval for the general concept.

Develop an initial Project Proposal that adequately demonstrates core concepts for your Final Project. A project proposal is sometimes referred to as a "Project Treatment" or "Concept" document. Be sure to follow best practices you learned throughout the degree regarding documentation.

Please note: All documentation provided in this class should be professionally branded and contain contact information. If you have not done so already, begin to create a brand for your company (or self) and utilize it throughout this project.

Your proposal should include:

A rough sketch of key concepts
Descriptive call-outs that explain functionality
Brief copy that introduces core ideas
Branding

A hand drawn sketch is acceptable as long as it includes the elements listed above. Formal composition or wireframes are not expected at this time. See this week's Reading & Resources activity for examples. Typically this style of conceptual overview is 1-3 pages long and not overly detailed. This encourages discussion and stakeholder involvement.
